# Executor

Run commands in a fancy way.

## About executor

This is a small program just made to run any shell commands with visual feedback, timing and some other features, giving it a better and professional look.

This is not intended to be an alternative to `make` or `task`, this is just a complement. When your `make` output is too much to understand, `executor` helps you to see, in a single look, if everything goes ok.

### Output shading

Executor hides the standard and error output, displaying it only on error or as instructed via command line flags.

### Not interactive mode

Automatic detection of terminal type, acts as a simple log without colors or spinners when the output is not a terminal or the flag `--no-color` is activated.

- Check if a port is open (`port`).
- Check if a web page is responding successfully (`web`).

Check the included help `--help` for more info.
